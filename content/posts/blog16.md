Build session
On Tuesday the 21st February, Team VSD had conducted a robotics workshop for free in Hamara school for the underprivileged children. Later we met physically at our mentor’s house. Sai Pranav, Avneesh, Taksh, Venkatesh, Dhruv and Shounak were present. We met for the driver practice of the robot. All of us wanted to see if the robot was fully working but suddenly the robot got bugged and stopped working. Sai pranav had also made a new replacement to the robot he had 3-d designed a cone-lock and had attached it below the cone-holder that held the cones. When the robot got bugged, we removed the original cone-holder. Avneesh, Shounak and Dhruv attached the newly designed cone-holder to the robot. After that, we figured out why the robot was bugged. Then we started testing the robot. While testing we came up with a wonderful solution because of the cone-lock the cones were tightly held inside the cone-holder. We thought that when the slider was taken up, the cone-lock could also be put in its dumping position. The cone inside the cone-holder wouldn’t fall as we had attached a cone-lock. 
This way our accuracy of scoring points would increase plus this method was faster and it could also help us to score more points.
