As part of the First Tech Challenge competition's outreach activity, Team Legogoa Axi0m conducted a two-day Lego robotics workshop at the Innovation hub, Goa Science centre. 
12 participants attended the workshop, and Sai Pranav Gandhi commenced the session by explaining what robots are, how they function, and what sensors and motors are? Shounak Hede explained how to code a Robot and also gave a brief introduction to FTC. 
All the participants were split into 4  teams, each consisting of 3 members, and they started building the basic EV3 Robot. We helped the participants understand how Lego Mindstorm works and helped them when they had issues while assembling a Robot. After building the Robot, we helped teams connect it to the computer using Bluetooth and USB connection. Then we explained to them how the coding software of Ev3 worked and how to use it. For demonstration, we taught them how to make a code to make the Robot move forward and backwards. Once they had used the coding software, we showed them how to take turns and asked them to code the Robot to traverse in a square. After trying a few times, they eventually Robots traversed in predetermined squares and then rectangles.

The next day, we added sensors and medium motors to the already assembled Robots. We started the coding by asking them to move the claw up and down and then to make it grab a block. After this, we asked them to try and make a traffic signal code wherein the Robot would move when the colour sensor saw green and stop when it senses the colour red. Most of the teams had experienced a little trouble while coding the colour sensor but eventually succeeded. Once they learnt how to use code, a colour sensor and motor movements, we introduced a little complex program of "Line Follower". We explained how a typical "Line Follower" code works and how to use them. A few teams could successfully code the line follower. However, a few teams required and additionalÂ explanation.
