 I conducted a workshop to create awareness about various coding-robotics competitions held at the international/national/state level. It was a 3-hour workshop. The students from grade 5 to grade 10 attended the workshop. I conducted it at Progress High School (Government School) free of cost!

The students were very excited to attend. I got a chance to clear up various doubts. They also had a fear of learning robotics. After attending this workshop, this fear was gone. I motivated them to participate in the Codeavour 2022 AI competition. This competition is free of cost for Goa Board students of std 6th to 8th.
I also introduced them to other innovation-based STEM competitions conducted by Atal Innovation Mission and other government schemes. I also took their contact number to provide them with E-certificates. I had a wonderful experience interacting with government school children.
