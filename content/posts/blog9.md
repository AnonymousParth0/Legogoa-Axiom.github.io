On 4 January 2023,Mr Ashwin Shah, the mentor of team Sigma and many other FTC teams took a session to advise us on how to maintain the engineering notebook.

He explained to us that the engineering notebook is one of the most important aspects of advancing in the First Tech Challenge as it is the basis on which the judges would judge our work.

He advised us on how we should devote 3 to 4 days to our engineering notebook before beginning our builds by dividing ourselves into teams under the categories of engineering, outreach and fundraising and collect information from each group and filling it into a predefined template.

He also informed us of the next stage of our documentation journey,that is the engineering portfolio and analysis of engineering notebook by the means of charts and graphs.
