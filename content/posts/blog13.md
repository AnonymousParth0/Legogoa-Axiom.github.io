The three day FTC workshop has been highly successful at multiple fronts. 
The team secured advice from a senior team about the gaps in the strategy and also improvements in design of the robot.
We also got a good team bonding experience due to sessions by Expert Karuna Satardekar 
We managed good visibility with the visit of Honble Minister for Tourism and IT visiting us as Chief Guest. 
We got Fantastic media visibility at state level due to wide press coverage.
We managed to raise a significant amount of money due to the efforts of parents.
Presence of two individuals ie Vincent Toscano from island, Chorao who has arranged a session for our team with parents in last week of February to convince the chorao parents to travel to pune to witness the competition so that they are motivated to form a team next year, second person being computer teacher from mahalasa Narayani school, Verna who was present for all three days with four students and is motivated to start team this year itself. This proves that we have made a fantastic and effective outreach in motivating two teams to join FTC. The national ftc organisers are immensely happy and are trying arrange free entry and kit for this Verna team 
The entire 3 day event has been organised smoothly with perfect hospitality to all the visitors. 
The parents' involvement in organising the event made all the difference and it will surely be a beacon for the other teams in india. 
However there is a lot of work yet to be done and milestones to be crossed. with exams for six kids next week onwards it Makes it more challenging. Letâ€™s keep up With the complete involvement of parents and underlying passion, I am sure our team will have immense learning and success
