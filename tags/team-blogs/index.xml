We welcomed them and they were ecstatic to watch our robot in action and noted all the areas that could be improved. We worked on the robot till about 7 in the evening and that’s when the team-building exercises started where we played a few games which helped us get to know each other better.</description></item><item><title>Ftc workshop</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog13/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog13/</guid><description>The three day FTC workshop has been highly successful at multiple fronts. The team secured advice from a senior team about the gaps in the strategy and also improvements in design of the robot. We also got a good team bonding experience due to sessions by Expert Karuna Satardekar We managed good visibility with the visit of Honble Minister for Tourism and IT visiting us as Chief Guest. We got Fantastic media visibility at state level due to wide press coverage.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Session</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog12/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog12/</guid><description>On 10th January, we met physically at our mentor’s house. Venkatesh , Sai Pranav and Avneesh were present.
Venkatesh and Avneesh, were working on fixing the robot. That was tightening the tyres along with the axcel, the bearing and the gears. We did this as the tyres were loose and were shaking and could make the robot unstable. This was a very tedious process. Venkatesh and I failed multiple times before we managed to get it right.</description></item><item><title>Build session</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog11/</guid><description>On Sunday the 8th Jan, we met physically at our mentor&amp;rsquo;s house. Viraj and Vighnesh conducted a session for the team members to learn about pull requests. Aditya, Aniket and Dhruv attended the session. Aniket even created a pull request regarding this outreach activity at Progress High School.
For the first building part of the chassis, the three of us were Sai Pranav, Viraj and Druv. We realised we did not have enough parts to make the strafer chassis last time because we had opened the assembly manual for the strafer chassis v5, but our kit was that of v4.</description></item><item><title>Visit to Additive Manufacturing Hub</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog6/</guid><description>On 28 December 2022, FTC Team LegoGoa Axiom became the first customer for Additive manufacturing hub inaugurated at the IT Department in Altinho this year.
Due to the need for high precision and efficient parts, FTC Team LegoGoa Axiom requested AM hub to 3D print the claw which will be used to grab and lift cones as part of the required task for First Tech Challenge.
At the lab the staff present there explained the process of 3D printing to the students and also provided knowledge regarding the difference between the fusion type 3D printers and additive type 3D printers, the process of plastic mold injection and the different types of materials with which 3d printers work.</description></item><item><title>Having fun</title><link>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://legogoa-axiom.github.io/posts/blog4/</guid><description>Having fun is primary at Team Legogoa meetups and we had celebrations by cutting of a cake by the birthday boy Shounak. We had a twist with the cake cutting as shounak used a slider with a knife to cut the robot themed cake.
^We also had a serious monkey storming session as evident from the picture.
We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.</description></item></channel></rss>
